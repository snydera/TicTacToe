# TicTacToe
A Tic Tac Toe prototype game in Unity

Unity version 2022.3.10f1

Thank you for taking a look at my Tic-Tac-Toe game. It was made in less than two days in a marathon session of 3D modeling, coding, development and debugging. I'm happy with how it turned out and might add to it in the future. You are welcome to view the project and see its inner workings. For a Windows build of the game, you will find the exe in the Builds folder. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!

Yours,

Adam Snyder
